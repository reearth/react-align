# React Align Example

This example demonstrates the usage of react-align library.

## Important Notes

- This example uses **Vite 3.x** to demonstrate compatibility with older tooling
- The example imports from the built library rather than source code
- The main package is built with Vite 7, but the library itself is compatible with projects using older Vite versions

## Running the Example

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Known Issues

- `react-beautiful-dnd` is deprecated and may have compatibility warnings with React 18
- The library continues to work but you may see console warnings about `defaultProps`
