# React Align Example

This example demonstrates the usage of react-align library.

## Important Notes

- This example uses **Vite 3.x** to demonstrate compatibility with older tooling
- The example imports from the built library rather than source code
- The main package is built with Vite 7, but the library itself is compatible with projects using older Vite versions

## Running the Example

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Drag and Drop

- Uses `@hello-pangea/dnd` (a maintained fork of the deprecated `react-beautiful-dnd`)
- Fully compatible with React 18 and future React versions
